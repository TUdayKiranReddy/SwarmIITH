# SwarmIITH
## A team of 13 members participating in Flipkart Grid 3.0 - Robotics Challenge which occurred in October 2021
The task was to design four ground vehicles that would autonomously move from point A to point B, along a specified track, WITHOUT any perception sensors installed on board. 
A camera was installed on top of the arena, whose feed would be used to estimate the current position of the bot and its distance from the destination.
Using OpenCV, the pose is estimated with the help of Aruco markers kept on top of the bot and at the start and end points.

## Structure of the repo
1. The "markers" folder contains the images of the aruco marker IDs used in the project.
